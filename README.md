# Half-Life Unified SDK Map Decompiler

The Half-Life Unified SDK Map Decompiler is a cross-platform map decompiler for Half-Life 1 BSP version 30 files.

Unlike bspc and tools derived from it this decompiler does not support other Quake engine derivative BSP files.

Whereas bspc was written in C this tool is written in C# to make its source code more accessible and easier to maintain.

This tool is part of the Half-Life Unified SDK. See the main [Unified SDK](https://github.com/SamVanheer/halflife-unified-sdk) repository for more information.

Based on Quake 3's bspc tool: https://github.com/id-Software/Quake-III-Arena
